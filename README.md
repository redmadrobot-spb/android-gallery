## Requirements
For proper work you need AndroidX in your project. If you are still using support library, use this [deprecated version of android-gallery](https://github.com/redmadrobot-spb/android-gallery-old).
## Install
Add this in your root build.gradle file: 
```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

After that add library to your module:
```groovy
implementation 'com.redmadrobot.gallery:android-gallery:latest.version.here'
```
## Usage
All you need to create list of your media content is URL of each of image/video. 
Just create list of `Media`:
```kotlin
fun createGallery() {
  val listOfMedia = arrayListOf(
            Media(
                    thumbnailUrl = "http://mazwai.com/system/posts/videos/000/000/183/poster_3/a_sky_full_of_stars.png", 
                    type = MediaType.VIDEO,
                    url = "http://mazwai.com/system/posts/videos/000/000/183/original/a_sky_full_of_stars.mp4"
            ),
            Media(
                    thumbnaulUrl = "https://images.pexels.com/photos/459225/pexels-photo-459225.jpeg",
                    type = MediaType.IMAGE,
                    url = "https://images.pexels.com/photos/459225/pexels-photo-459225.jpeg"
            ))
}
```  
Pass created list to `GalleryFragment` with the position of image you want to view. 
After that you can show fragment by passing `FragmentManager` and fragment tag to `show` method:
```kotlin
fun onImageClick(position: Int) {
  GalleryFragment
              .create(listOfMedia, position)
              .show(supportFragmentManager, "fragment_tag_gallery")
}
```
For more information just look throw the sample.
